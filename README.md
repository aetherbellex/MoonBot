# MoonBot

A simple bot for the chat program [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) that will tell you the moon phase for today, to the nearest quarter phase. This was created in Java using the [Discord4J library](https://github.com/austinv11/Discord4J) mostly as an exercise for myself and not intended for public use. Information about the moon phase is pulled from the U.S. Naval Observatory's website using their API as described [here](http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/api.php#phase).

## Usage

The bot has to be invited to a server of your choice by visting a specific URL (to be added). Once the bot is a part of a server, and while the bot is running, typing the command "!moon" in a channel will activate the bot and cause it to return the current phase of the moon.
